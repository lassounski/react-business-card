                I am a Java ninja that loves creating beautifully written, highly performant and efficient software. Through my 10+ years of experience I have been working in all kinds of fields. That gave me a lot of knowledge on clean code, great communication skills and most importantly, sponge like learning abilities. I have a passion for software testing and automation, micro service architectures and cloud computing.
